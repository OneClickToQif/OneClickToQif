**_OneClickToQIF_** is a project consisting of a series of spreadsheet templates and macros, which are used to export data (such as bank accounts, mortgage ...) to QIF format, used by programs such as GnuCash, Money and Quicken.

With **_OneClickToQIF_** you can export, in just one click, **all the tabs in your spreadsheet**, both for simple and split transactions.

You can use the templates provided, or easily **adapt your own existing spreadsheet**, without any knowledge of macros.
Every tab is automatically exported from the spreadsheet to QIF files, both assets (bank accounts, cash ...) and liabilities (credit cards, mortgage ...).

You **do not need to indicate each time the columns containing data**, or the transactions to be exported: just label the columns the first time you use the template. Only new movements (those who have never been exported) will be exported to the QIF file.
